#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:16
msgid "The first step in troubleshooting synchronization issues is to verify that you can log on to the Nextcloud web application. To verify connectivity to the Nextcloud server try logging in via your Web browser."
msgstr ""

#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:20
msgid "If you are not prompted for your username and password, or if a red warning box appears on the page, your server setup requires modification. Please verify that your server installation is working correctly."

msgid "Ensure the WebDAV API is working"
msgstr ""

#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:25
msgid "If all desktop clients fail to connect to the Nextcloud Server, but access using the Web interface functions properly, the problem is often a misconfiguration of the WebDAV API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:29
msgid "The Nextcloud Client uses the built-in WebDAV access of the server content. Verify that you can log on to Nextcloud's WebDAV server. To verify connectivity with the Nextcloud WebDAV server:"

msgid "Open a browser window and enter the address to the Nextcloud WebDAV server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:35
msgid "For example, if your Nextcloud instance is installed at ``http://yourserver.com/nextcloud``, your WebDAV server address is ``http://yourserver.com/nextcloud/remote.php/dav``."

msgid "Use a WebDAV command line tool to test"
msgstr ""

#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:44
msgid "A more sophisticated test method for troubleshooting synchronization issues is to use a WebDAV command line client and log into the Nextcloud WebDAV server. One such command line client -- called ``cadaver`` -- is available for Linux distributions. You can use this application to further verify that the WebDAV server is running properly using PROPFIND calls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:50
msgid "As an example, after installing the ``cadaver`` app, you can issue the ``propget`` command to obtain various properties pertaining to the current directory and also verify WebDAV server connection."

msgstr ""

#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:79
msgid "Synchronizing the same directory with Nextcloud and other synchronization software such as Unison, rsync, Microsoft Windows Offline Folders, or other cloud services such as Dropbox or Microsoft SkyDrive is not supported and should not be attempted. In the worst case, it is possible that synchronizing folders or files using Nextcloud and other synchronization software or services can result in data loss."
msgstr ""

#: ../../troubleshooting.rst:86
msgid "If you find that only specific files are not synchronized, the synchronization protocol might be having an effect. Some files are automatically ignored because they are system files, other files might be ignored because their filename contains characters that are not supported on certain file systems. For more information about ignored files, see :ref:`ignored-files-label`."
