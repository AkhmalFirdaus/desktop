msgid "The Nextcloud Client packages contain a command line client, ``nextcloudcmd``, that can be used to synchronize Nextcloud files to client machines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../nextcloudcmd.rst:4
msgid "``nextcloudcmd`` performs a single *sync run* and then exits the synchronization process. In this manner, ``nextcloudcmd`` processes the differences between client and server directories and propagates the files to bring both repositories to the same state. Contrary to the GUI-based client, ``nextcloudcmd`` does not repeat synchronizations on its own. It also does not monitor for file system changes."
